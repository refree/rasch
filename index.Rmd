## 전처리 

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
library(TAM)
hls2 <- read.csv("data_step0.csv", header = T)

#str(hls2)
hls2[hls2 =="2"]<- NA
str(hls2)
names(hls2)

mod2 <- tam(hls2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(mod2, type = "items")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
